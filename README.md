### Testing and Debugging Process

1. **Initial Test Execution**:
    - Upon executing the initial code, the "Join" button did not function as expected.
    - Conducted a code review and identified several syntax errors.
    - Corrected the syntax errors to ensure proper execution of the code.

2. **Second Test Execution**:
    - Re-ran the code after making the necessary fixes.
    - After clicking the "Join" button, the browser prompted for camera and audio permissions.
    - Granted the required permissions; however, the video output was still not visible.

3. **Browser Compatibility Check**:
    - Switched the browser from Brave to Microsoft Edge.
    - On Microsoft Edge, both video and audio outputs were visible.
    - Determined that the issue was related to Brave browserâ€™s lack of support for WebRTC.
